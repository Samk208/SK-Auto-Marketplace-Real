# The $5,000 Question

"How much will it _actually_ cost to get this car to my driveway?"

This is the most common question we get. A car listed for $8,000 in Korea does not cost $8,000 in Lagos. Depending on your country, the final landed cost can be double that.

Let's break down the math using a real-world example: A **2019 Hyundai Tucson**.

# The Cost Breakdown

### 1. The FOB Price (Free On Board)

This is the price of the car itself, plus the cost to get it to the Korean port.

- **Car Price:** $9,500
- **Korea Local Logistics:** Included in SK AutoSphere pricing.
- **Total FOB:** **$9,500**

### 2. Ocean Freight (Shipping)

This is the ticket for the boat ride. Prices fluctuate with oil prices.

- **Destinations:** Lagos (Apapa/Tin Can), Mombasa, Tema, Dar es Salaam.
- **Average Cost (SUV):** **$1,300 - $1,600**
- **Insurance:** Optional but recommended (~$150).

### 3. Import Duty & Clearing (The Big One)

This is where most buyers get confused. Customs duty is calculated on the _CIF Value_ (Cost of Car + Insurance + Freight).

#### **For Nigeria 🇳🇬**

- **Duty:** 35% (varies by age)
- **Levy:** 0-35%
- **VAT:** 7.5%
- _Rough Estimate:_ **~50-60% of vehicle value**.
- _Example Cost:_ ~$5,500 - $6,500

#### **For Kenya 🇰🇪**

- **Import Duty:** 25%
- **Excise Duty:** Varies (20% - 35%)
- **VAT:** 16%
- _Rough Estimate:_ **Often equals ~75-90% of the FOB value**.
- _Example Cost:_ ~$7,000+

#### **For Ghana 🇬🇭**

- Based on engine CC and year.
- _Example Cost:_ ~$4,500 - $5,500

### 4. Local Port Charges & Handling

Don't forget the local fees!

- **Terminal Handling Charges:** $300 - $500
- **Clearing Agent Fee:** $300 - $600
- **Registration/Plates:** $100 - $200

# How to Reduce Your Costs

You can legally lower your import bill by being smart:

1.  **Buy Older Models:** In Ghana and Nigeria, slightly older cars (within the allowed age limit) often attract lower valuations.
2.  **Ship RORO:** Container shipping protects the car better but costs $1,000+ more. RORO is safe and standard.
3.  **Buy in Bulk:** If you are a dealer, shipping multiple cars in one container can reduce the per-unit freight cost.
4.  **Use SK AutoSphere:** We have negotiated rates with major shipping lines (Eukor, Glovis) that are often lower than public rates.

### Transparent Pricing

At SK AutoSphere, we provide a **Landed Cost Calculator** for every vehicle. No guessing games. We show you the estimates upfront so you can budget properly.

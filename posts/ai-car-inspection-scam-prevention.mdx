# The $8,000 Mistake

Last year, a dealer in Lagos ordered a "Grade A" 2018 Kia Sportage from a generic export site. The photos looked perfect. The inspection report said "Clean."

When the car arrived at Tin Can Island Port 6 weeks later, reality hit. The passenger door had been repainted (badly) to hide a massive collision. The chassis was bent. The car was unsellable. He lost $8,000 instantly.

**The Inspection Report had been faked.** The inspector, paid minimum wage, likely took a bribe from the seller to mark it "Clean."

# Humans Lie. Code Doesn't.

At SK AutoSphere, we realized the biggest barrier to trade wasn't logistics—it was **Trust**. And in a high-stakes transaction like a car purchase, "trusting" a stranger thousands of miles away is risky.

So we removed the stranger.

### Introducing The Truth Scanner (AI)

We developed an AI-powered Vision System trained on millions of vehicle images. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't take bribes. It just sees.

#### How It Works:

1.  **360° Scan:** Every car we list undergoes a high-res video spin.
2.  **Damage Detection:** Our AI analyzes the footage frame-by-frame. It detects:
    - **Panel Gaps:** Indicators of previous accidents.
    - **Paint Mismatches:** Signs of repair.
    - **Scratches & Dents:** Even tiny ones that might be photoshopped out.
3.  **Odometer Verification:** It cross-references the dashboard photo with the official Korean transport ministry database history. Discrepancy? **FLAGGED.**

# Case Study: The "Clean" Sonata

Recently, our system flagged a 2020 Hyundai Sonata. To the human eye, it looked flawless.

**The Truth Scanner found:**

1.  Slight color deviation on the rear bumper (98% vs 100% factory white).
2.  Micro-alignment issue on the trunk lid.

**Result:** We pulled the history report. This "Clean" car had a rear-end collision 6 months ago. The seller tried to hide it. **We rejected the car.** It never made it to our platform.

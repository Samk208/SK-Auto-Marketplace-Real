## Popular Matchups

### Sedans: Hyundai Sonata vs Kia K5

- **Cabin:** Sonata is quieter and more premium; K5 uses sportier seats and lighting.
- **Performance:** Sonata offers a balanced ride; K5 brings slightly sharper steering.
- **Price:** Sonata typically lands at $12k–$15k; K5 at $11k–$14k.

### SUVs: Hyundai Tucson vs Kia Sportage

- **Tech:** Tucson sticks to a conservative UI; Sportage adds panoramic displays and AR navigation.

## Practical Factors for African Roads

- **Suspension:** Hyundai tunes slightly firmer—better for rough corridors like Lagos–Ibadan.
- **Parts Availability:** Shared supply chain; parts interchangeable in many cases.
- **Diagnostics:** Kia's newer CAN systems need updated scanners—ensure your workshop has them.
- **Ground Clearance:** If you run rural delivery routes, Tucson/Santa Fe clearance is safer.

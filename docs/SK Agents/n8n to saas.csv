Intro
0:00
So, you've built your NAND workflow, but
0:02
it's sitting there doing nothing. No
0:04
users, no revenue, no product. But what
0:07
if I told you we could take that
0:09
workflow and turn it into a full-fledged
0:11
AI SAS in a single cloud code session?
0:14
I'm talking front end, backend,
0:16
authentication, databases, deployment,
0:18
all without writing a single line of
0:21
code. Well, that is exactly what I'm
0:22
going to teach you today as I show you
0:24
how to go from a simple NAND workflow
0:27
and turn it into an actual AI SAS
0:29
product. And what sounds extremely
0:31
intimidating on the surface is actually
0:33
much simpler than you think. And it is a
0:36
skill you 100% need to have if you want
0:38
to make money with AI as we move into
0:40
2026. So, this is going to be a fun one.
0:43
There's a ton of value in this lesson.
0:44
So, let's just get started. So, the
Lesson Overview
0:46
ultimate goal of today's video is to
0:48
show you how to take your NADN AI
0:50
automation or agent and turn it into
0:52
this an actual SAS product. Now, along
0:55
the way, we're going to hit on a number
0:57
of different things, right? I'm going to
0:59
show you how to do the front end, which
1:01
is what you see here. How to do the back
1:03
end, which is the, you know, coding
1:05
logic that makes sure when I click
1:06
different buttons, things actually work.
1:08
I'm going to show you how to set up
1:10
authentication, so you can actually log
1:12
in and data can be set for specific
1:14
users. I'm going to show you how to set
1:16
up a database to store all that data
1:18
using superbase. I'm going to show you
1:20
how to deploy the app using Verscell.
1:23
And really what I'm going to show you is
1:25
how to harness the power of Cloud Code.
1:27
Now, if you hear Claude Code and you
1:29
instantly get a little anxious because
1:30
you've never used it before, that's
1:32
okay. I'm going to link a video above
1:33
that is essentially a beginner's guide
1:35
to Claude Code. You do not have to be
1:37
that technical to use this tool. So,
1:39
don't let that lack of experience stop
1:41
you. If you watch that video, it should
1:43
take you about 30 40 minutes. You'll be
1:45
ready to go for this lesson. So, before
1:47
we start our Cloud Code adventure, let's
1:49
just talk about what this automation is
1:51
actually doing so we're all on the same
1:53
page. So, this is just a viral Tik Tok
1:56
video analyzer. The user inputs a
1:58
submission saying, "Hey, this is the
1:59
channel I want to look at." It then uses
2:01
an Appify scraper to scrape the latest
2:04
five videos from there. And then it does
2:06
analysis on the videos using Gemini. So,
2:09
it's breaking down, hey, here's the
2:10
hooks they use. to use their general
2:11
call to action, their story lines.
2:13
Here's what they're doing. Here's what
2:15
you could do to replicate that, right?
2:17
Is to help people create short form
2:18
content. What you see here is actually a
2:21
simplified version of it, which I
2:23
simplified simply for time. And I have a
2:25
full video that breaks down this
2:27
in-depth, and I'll link that above.
2:28
Hint, you can actually get the workflow
2:30
for this one by heading to my free
2:32
school community. Check the pin comment.
2:34
And so, we want to take this viral video
2:36
analyzer and sassify it, right? So what
2:40
that looks like in the SAS product is
2:42
once I log in I'm then brought to this
2:44
page which is the analysis and then I
2:46
simply input the channel name of
2:49
whatever video I'm trying to analyze.
2:50
That analysis is then completed on the
2:52
back end inside of NADN which then
2:54
pushes the output back to our web page.
2:57
And so you see the video breakdown
2:59
analysis, right? The concept, the
3:00
audience, a hook analysis, content
3:03
structure, visual style and recreation
3:06
framework, right? So that's what our app
3:09
is doing, but we've taken it outside of
3:12
this and actually put a pretty face on
3:15
it. So you could, you know, hey, scale
3:17
this up, throw Stripe on it, actually
3:19
charge people for this product. So how
Creating the Claude.md File
3:21
do you do that for your particular end
3:25
automation or agent? So, what we need to
3:27
do is we need to essentially break down
3:29
what our automation does, what we want
3:31
our app to look like, and we're going to
3:33
put that inside of a document that's
3:35
known as a PRD, a product requirements
3:37
document. That's just us putting our
3:39
thoughts on paper. Now, what that is
3:41
eventually going to turn into is it's
3:43
going to turn into a document called
3:45
claude.md.
3:47
That's kind of what you see right here.
3:50
Now, claude.m MD, this is a file for
3:53
claude code to look at that gives it a
3:54
broad overview of essentially what it is
3:56
you're trying to build. This gives it
3:58
constant context for it to understand,
4:01
hey, this is what they want me to
4:03
actually create. That way, as you create
4:05
your project, as you do all these
4:06
things, it always has a document to go
4:08
and reference and essentially ground it,
4:10
right? So, it's never like, oh man, I
4:12
forgot what I'm building, right? I
4:13
forgot the architecture. We're going to
4:15
lay all that out at the beginning so we
4:17
know exactly what we're building, what
4:20
the tech stack is. That way when cloud
4:22
coder goes to work, we're not stopping
4:24
in the middle of the project and being
4:25
like, hm, what should we actually do for
4:28
our database? What should we actually do
4:30
for our backend architecture? We're
4:32
going to figure all that out on the
4:33
front side. And if that is fleshed out
4:35
very, very well, it's going to make this
4:37
process so much easier. And so to help
4:39
you out, I've created this PRD/Claude MD
4:42
template that you can take and then
4:43
bring to Claude code and you can have a
4:45
conversation with Claude to flesh this
4:47
out and it will establish essentially
4:49
your architecture and your vision for
4:51
what it is you're trying to build. And
4:53
so what it talks about is first is your
4:54
end automation like what does it do?
4:56
What are the inputs? What are the
4:57
outputs? And then we go into things like
4:59
the front end and the back end, the
5:01
database, the authentication, and then
5:03
hosting. Now you'll notice here inside
5:05
the template I include a lot of default
5:08
things for you already especially with
5:10
the text stack right I'm saying hey we
5:12
should do this with NexJS14 with an app
5:15
router we're going to be superbase for
5:17
our backend now you don't have to use
5:19
this I put these in here in case you're
5:21
kind of just like I don't really know
5:22
what to do Chase like this is my first
5:24
time doing it like what do you recommend
5:26
well this is what I recommend and the
5:28
reason I recommend these things is
5:29
because this is stuff that AI tends to
5:31
be really good at when it comes to
5:33
coding right next JS sort of
5:35
architecture and so you know you're not
5:37
going off the beaten path here. It has
5:38
tons of training data on it and it's
5:40
going to give you a good product. And so
5:41
what we're going to do is we're going to
5:42
copy this whole template and we're going
5:43
to bring it into cloud code. Now before
5:45
we open up cloud code I want you to just
5:47
create a new folder somewhere. It can be
5:49
anywhere probably in your documents. I'm
5:51
just going to do it on the desktop so
5:53
you can see it. And this is where our
5:55
project is going to be. So we're just
5:56
going to call this nadn SAS test. Right.
6:00
Right. Smack dab in my desktop. And then
6:03
I'm going to open up claude code. So I
6:05
run claude code inside of cursor. So I
6:07
open up cursor. I just went to open new
6:09
folder. I click my new folder. And here
6:12
we go. So I'm going to start a new
6:13
terminal. I'm just going to type in
6:15
cloud. Now what I want to do is I first
6:17
just want to add a new file inside of my
6:19
folder. So I'm going to come up to the
6:20
left. I'm just going to call this um
6:23
prompt one. And inside here I'm going to
6:26
paste inside that template. And then the
6:28
second thing I'm going to do is I'm
6:29
actually going to download my N&N
6:31
workflow JSON. and I'm going to put it
6:32
into this folder as well so it can
6:34
understand what it's working with. And
6:35
so alls I did is I dragged and dropped
6:37
that JSON over here to the left. So
6:39
we've given it the template and the
6:40
JSON. So now I just said take a look at
6:43
the prompt one file and the Naden JSON I
6:45
just dropped in. I want to create an AI
6:47
SAS using the Naden automation as the
6:49
back end. Let's run through the prompt
6:51
one template to start. We will use that
6:52
as the base for cloudmd file you will
6:54
create. You will also notice I'm on plan
6:57
mode. So right now we're just having a
6:58
conversation with the AI cuz all we want
7:00
to do our goal is to get on the same
7:01
page in terms of what the heck the plan
7:04
is. So as it goes through the template
7:06
and the JSON file, it's going to have a
7:08
number of questions for you with
7:09
potential answers. Don't be afraid to
7:12
just type something in here if you have
7:14
no idea what it's asking for. You need
7:16
some more context. But what you will
7:17
probably get asked at some point is a
7:19
web hook question. And this is
7:21
important. So let's talk about sort of
7:22
the web hook infrastructure because web
7:24
hooks are how we connect this NADN
7:26
backend essentially to the front end. So
7:29
this is what your N automation probably
7:30
looks like. It has some sort of input,
7:32
some sort of output. These inputs and
7:34
outputs will need to change when we turn
7:35
it into a SAS because we can no longer
7:38
use a form submission and we can no
7:40
longer have it terminate with Air Table.
7:42
We need a way to connect it to here to
7:45
what you have online. And to do that,
7:47
we're going to use a web hook. Now the
7:50
way the web hook works is when someone
7:53
submits something on my web page, right?
7:55
They want to look at a channel. That's a
7:57
certain amount of information. That
7:59
information is going to be sent to this
8:01
web hook. From there, it does everything
8:03
it needs to do. And then we need to send
8:05
a response back to our web app that
8:09
says, "Hey, here's the output. Here's
8:10
all the information I got." Because all
8:12
this video breakdown, right? All the
8:14
stuff you see here, this is created here
8:16
inside of NADN. We just need some way to
8:19
push it there. And so on the back end,
8:21
we will be doing an HTTP request. Why do
8:25
we not have a respond to web hook
8:26
request like you've seen in previous
8:28
videos? Well, because it may take longer
8:31
than you think, and we don't want to
8:33
deal with any sort of timeouts. As for
8:35
the HTTP request, we're going to do
8:36
post. For the URL, this will change, but
8:38
we'll just set it to localhost for now.
8:40
What I want you to do then is to save
8:42
it, set it to active, bring back the web
8:45
hook, and go to production URL and copy
8:48
that. At some point, Cloud Code will ask
8:50
you if you have your Nitend URL ready.
8:52
I'm going to say, hey, I have it ready.
8:53
It's now asking if you have a domain.
8:55
I'm just going to say we will test
8:57
inside of local host for now. And then
9:00
I'm just going to submit my answers. So,
9:02
you will continue that back and forth
9:03
with Claude until you're satisfied with
9:05
sort of the plan it's come up with. If
9:07
it is close to your vision and you think
9:08
it has a good grasp of what you're
9:10
trying to build, we're going to go ahead
9:11
and move forward and you can just hit
9:13
shift tab and you can move off of plan
9:15
mode. You should have been on plan mode
9:16
to start. We can go to accept edits and
9:18
you're just going to tell it, hey, I now
9:20
want you to create that claw.md file.
9:23
And this is that claw.md file. Again,
9:25
this looks very similar to the template
9:27
we were looking at before, but now now
9:30
it has filled out everything, right? We
9:32
have our web hook URL in here. It's
9:34
looked at some of the JSON elements of
9:36
how data is going to look when it both
9:37
comes in and out of the automation. And
9:40
essentially all the architecture we have
9:42
built is right here. Now if for whatever
9:45
reason you're like you know what I don't
9:46
know if this is legit, you know what you
9:47
can do? You can take something like
9:49
this, copy paste it, bring it to chat
9:51
GPT, bring it to Gemini, you can always
9:53
get a second opinion from other AI
9:55
systems to make sure Claude hasn't
9:57
hallucinated some crazy plan. But by and
9:59
large, by following the template and by
10:01
doing an app with this sort of text
10:02
stack, it's going to give you something
10:03
that's solid. So now it's time to let
Creating the Project
10:05
Claw just go to work, right? We're going
10:08
to let it spread its wings and fly. And
10:09
now we're going to tell it begin with
10:11
the project setup. So begin with the
10:15
project setup. And now it's going to
10:18
send it and it's going to start coding
10:20
everything. Now, as it does this, you're
10:22
going to get a lot of questions where
10:23
it's going to ask you, hey, do you want
10:25
to proceed with this command? You're
10:26
going to have the options for yes and
10:28
yes, don't ask again. For the most part,
10:30
you're going to want to do just yes,
10:31
don't ask again. There is an option,
10:33
right? If I do a new terminal and I were
10:36
starting up claude, another claude code
10:38
terminal,
10:39
if I do claude space- dangerly skip
10:43
permission, dangerously skip
10:44
permissions. This essentially allows
10:47
Claude to bypass ever asking my
10:49
permission for certain commands. So, I
10:51
don't suggest doing this right away if
10:53
you have no idea what it's doing. But
10:55
understand um as you get a little more
10:57
experience and if you're tired of
10:58
constantly giving it permission, there
11:00
is sort of the nuclear option. So, we
Supabase Setup
11:02
let cloud code go to work and you can
11:04
see it created the entire project
11:07
infrastructure for us. It breaks it down
11:09
in this graph, but you can also see
11:11
everything that was created over here on
11:13
the left. And so, now it gives us the
11:15
next steps of what it's going to do and
11:17
what we need to do. So what we are going
11:18
to need to do now is we need to set up
11:20
Superbase. We're going to need to
11:22
configure our environment variables and
11:24
then we need to update our N workflow
11:26
before we can finally start this app on
11:29
our local host aka on our computer to
11:32
test it out and see what we missed. So
11:34
the first thing we're going to do is
11:35
we're going to head to Superbase. This
11:36
is something you can do totally for
11:37
free. And Superbase is where our
11:39
database is going to live. So you're
11:41
going to head to superbase.com. You're
11:42
going to create an account and then
11:44
you're going to go to start your
11:45
project.
11:47
We're going to go to new project.
11:49
Call it whatever you want. We'll call
11:51
this naden YouTube test. Give it a
11:55
password. And then you're going to do
11:56
create new project. Now it's going to
11:57
take you to this page on the left. I
11:59
want you to go to SQL editor. And SQL
12:02
editor for all intents and purposes.
12:04
This is where we're going to put in some
12:06
code essentially and it's going to
12:08
create the structure for our actual
12:11
database tables. You could do this
12:12
manually or since Cloud Code is so
12:15
great, it gave us all the code to do it
12:16
automatically. And so it tells us that
12:18
as well. It says run the SQL schema from
12:20
cloud.md in the SQL editor. So we're
12:23
going to go back to our cloud MD file.
12:25
We're going to find that SQL. You can
12:27
see right here under database, right? It
12:30
gives us the schema and this is what
12:32
we're going to copy paste into there.
12:33
So, we're just going to go here, right
12:37
underneath SQL,
12:39
and we're going to copy all of this back
12:41
inside the SQL editor, paste this in
12:44
here, and right, and this does
12:46
everything, right? This is going to set
12:47
up the tables. It's going to set up the
12:49
row level security again. You just have
12:51
to copy paste. We're going to hit run
12:53
over here on the right. And then you
12:55
should see it say success. No rows
12:57
returned, right? That means it worked.
12:59
If you come over to the left and you
13:01
click on database, you can see what it
13:03
created, right? So, we have a table for
13:06
the actual jobs, right? The actual work
13:07
being done. And then we have our actual
13:09
profiles. And this is also going to play
13:11
into the authentication, which allows us
13:13
to, you know, have someone go on to the
13:14
website and create a profile based on
13:17
their email. And we're just going to
13:18
keep going down the list and knocking
13:19
out the things we need. So, next, it
13:21
needs us to copy our credentials over
13:22
tov.local.
13:24
So, if I come over here, you see over
13:26
here.v.local.
13:28
local.
13:30
Now, this section is essentially where
13:33
all of your secrets, so to speak, are
13:37
going to be posted. Now, it's av.local
13:41
file. So, the thing is eventually we're
13:43
going to push this to GitHub. These
13:45
secrets will not be exposed here, but
13:47
our project still needs to know about
13:49
them so it can actually talk to
13:50
Superbase and talk to all these things.
13:52
So, what you're going to do is we're
13:53
going to go into Superbase. We're going
13:54
to find those different secrets and
13:55
we're going to paste them into here. So,
13:57
we're going to hop back into Superbase.
13:58
You're going to come up here to the top
13:59
where it says connect. You're going to
14:01
go to app frameworks. And this is where
14:04
you're going to find your next public
14:05
Superbase URL. So, I'm going to copy
14:08
this. And don't worry, everything you
14:10
see here secrets wise and keywise for
14:12
me, I'm going to delete after this
14:13
video. Paste that in there. Next, we
14:15
need the Superbase Anon key. And to get
14:18
here, you'll go to project settings.
14:19
You're going to go to API keys on the
14:21
left. And this is where you're going to
14:22
see your anon public key as well as your
14:24
service ro secret. You're going to copy
14:26
both of these and paste them here in
14:29
their appropriate places. Next up, make
14:31
sure your NEN web hook URL matches the
14:33
production URL. And for now, we are not
14:36
going to be doing the NN web hook
14:38
secret, although that's something you
14:39
could always add at a later time. For
14:40
app URL, for now, local host is just
14:43
fine. This is something we will change
14:45
once we actually deploy it. So, make
14:46
sure you save that and we're set when it
14:48
comes to setting up our environment
14:49
variables. Next, it says we need to
14:51
update our NAN workflow. But as you'll
14:53
see, this is something we'll update once
14:55
we get the test server running. That
14:56
way, we can actually see what the data
14:58
looks like when it's flowing back and
14:59
forth. So now what we're going to do is
15:01
we're going to tell it we did all this
15:02
and we want to start our dev server. So
Testing Our App Locally
15:04
we told it to start up the dev server
15:06
and it gave us the link localhost 3000.
15:09
So we're just going to follow the link.
15:10
So here's where it took us. Obviously
15:12
hideous, right? But the UI is something
15:14
we can change later. First, we just want
15:16
to make sure the core functionalities
15:17
work. So let's check the authentication.
15:20
So going to go ahead and log in. So
15:22
let's do an email
15:25
and we'll do passwords. So we created
15:27
our account. Superbase then
15:29
automatically sent me an email to
15:30
confirm it. So confirm.
15:33
And now we'll log in again. So login is
15:35
working. Now it's time to test the
15:36
actual functionality of our app. Now
15:40
this will not work off the bat
15:42
immediately. So we're going to be doing
15:44
some troubleshooting with cloud code
15:45
inevitably and we will probably have to
15:47
tinker with the end workflow a little
15:49
bit as well. And so to do that just have
15:51
executions tab up and ready to go so we
15:53
can see how data is moving around. So
15:55
first test let's see what happens. All
15:57
right failed to create job. So all I'm
16:00
going to do is I'm going to go inside of
16:01
cloud code and tell it what happened. So
16:02
I just ran the error inside of cloud
16:04
code and it's telling me it looks like
16:05
there's an issue in Superbase with the
16:08
SQL code it gave us. So it gives us the
16:10
code to update it. So I'm just going to
16:12
copy this. Go to the SQL editor. Open up
16:15
a new tab. Paste this in. Right. It says
16:18
success. No rows returned. So let's try
16:20
again. And when I started the analysis
16:22
this time, we can see right away we get
16:24
a loading bar. So data got sent in some
16:27
form. Let's see if it uh also got sent
16:29
on the Naden side. So looking at our
16:31
executions tab, we have gotten some
16:33
data, which is important, right? The web
16:34
hook has a green check mark, which means
16:36
our web app over here is actually
16:39
sending data to NAND, although
16:40
something's getting stuck along the way.
16:42
But most importantly, we know data is
16:43
moving back and forth. So I'm going copy
16:45
to editor. But when I look at the Tik
16:47
Tok scraping, it looks like we have some
16:50
issues with what is being passed here.
16:51
You can see how this is read. So, I'm
16:53
just going to pull this up. And chances
16:54
are we just need to change how this is
16:56
mapped. So, what should be mapped here
16:58
is the actual profile. So, I'm just
17:01
going to delete this. And I'm going to
17:03
map over the username.
17:07
Now, that should work.
17:10
So, I'm going to ahead and save this.
17:11
And then what we're going to do is we're
17:14
going to go back to analysis and we're
17:16
just going to run this again and see
17:17
what happens. Now here's a look on our
17:19
second run and we can notice this looks
17:21
way better. We didn't get hung up on the
17:23
ampify node and data actually passed
17:25
through everything all the way till we
17:27
got to the final HTTP request which is
17:29
where we need to send data back up to
17:32
our app. So we're going to debug an
17:33
editor.
17:35
Unpin. I'm gonna go ahead and just pin
17:38
all this data for now so it doesn't
17:40
accidentally rerun it. And let's take a
17:42
look at our HTTP request.
17:45
So right now the the reason it's not
17:47
working should be obvious. This probably
17:49
isn't the right URL. And we're also not
17:51
sending an actual body. So what we're
17:53
going to do is we're just going to go to
17:54
cloud code and we're going to ask it
17:55
what we should do. So I just wrote I got
17:57
an error on the HTTP request node. At
17:59
the end of the execution, what should
18:00
the URL be and what should the JSON body
18:03
be? Now, you might not even know to
18:05
necessarily ask that question, right?
18:07
So, what you can also do is if you get
18:09
stuck in your workflow somehow, just
18:12
save the workflow, download it, and just
18:14
like we did at the beginning, drop it in
18:17
to the folder that you're working on.
18:18
That way, Claude Code has an updated
18:21
view of what's going on. And it can also
18:22
tell you, hey, this is what I think is
18:24
working. This is what isn't. This is
18:25
what we can change to get it working.
18:26
Right? So, this is what it's telling us
18:28
we should use for the callback URL. So,
18:30
let's see how what that looks like. I'm
18:32
going to copy that. Paste that in here.
18:34
Set it to expression. Now, this is red,
18:36
so I know this isn't exactly correct,
18:38
but it's trying to call back to a call
18:41
back URL. So, if I go back to the web
18:45
hook, does it give me a call back URL?
18:48
And it does. You see that right here at
18:50
the bottom with this. So, I'm going to
18:52
get rid of this.
18:54
Put this in here.
18:57
And there we go. Now, that should work.
18:59
Now, next, we need the JSON body. And
19:02
again, clawed code has provided. So, we
19:04
want to make sure we're on post. And
19:06
then this is the body we want to pass.
19:09
So, oftent times when it gives you this,
19:10
you'll notice it's red. So, it isn't
19:12
exactly correct. But, you know what it's
19:14
looking for, right? It's trying to
19:15
reference the original web hook and it
19:17
wants the job ID. So, alls I'm going to
19:19
do again, go back to the original web
19:21
hook. And I'm searching for the job ID.
19:23
And I see that right here. So, it gave
19:25
me a 90% solution, but you know, you're
19:27
smart enough to take a look at what it's
19:29
trying to do. Next, it's trying to do
19:31
videos. Now, what is this talking about?
19:33
Well, we know it's just JSON dot. So,
19:34
it's essentially trying to find the
19:36
output. So, if we go to the anal uh the
19:40
basic LLM chain, it wants this full
19:42
output. So, if I put this in here,
19:46
that's probably not going to work
19:47
either, right? See how it says object
19:49
object. So, what I'm going to do at this
19:50
point is I'll just make sure it's on the
19:54
last chain. And I'm just going to copy
19:55
all this JSON. Just click this right
19:56
here. And I'm going to say, hey, like
19:58
this is the output we're getting. How
20:00
should we set up the JSON body? So I
20:03
just said this is the output before the
20:05
HTTP request. And then I pasted in the
20:07
line. So now Cloud Code has context of
20:09
what I'm seeing in NAN. So it can give
20:11
me a better fix. So it's given me a
20:14
couple options, right? It gave me one
20:16
like this, which is a little more
20:17
complicated, but also a simpler
20:19
approach. So let's try this stringify
20:22
approach and see if that works. And so I
20:24
tried it. Stringify option that you see
20:26
right here. here and we can see over
20:26
here on the right here's all the data.
20:28
So it looks good. So let's see if third
20:30
time is a charm. The analyze video
20:34
and we'll bring up executions again. So
20:36
we ended up getting one more error on
20:38
the HTTP request. This time it says the
20:40
service refused the connection. So again
20:42
I'm just going to copy the errors and
20:43
bring it back into cloud code. Now you
20:46
can see in our latest run we've had a
20:47
successful NAND execution. Now what was
20:50
the latest thing we did here? Well the
20:51
latest thing we did was we introduced
20:54
Enro. Enro is something that allows us
20:56
to create a essentially temporary URL
20:59
because as you saw before we were
21:01
running into some issues where this HTTP
21:03
request wasn't able to go off because it
21:06
was trying to send it to our local host
21:07
aka our computer and it just couldn't do
21:09
that. So just by troubleshooting that
21:11
with cloud code, it was able to fix the
21:13
problem on its own. And here's what the
21:14
output looks like inside of our app.
21:16
Yes, it looks hideous, but we don't care
21:18
about that right now. We just wanted to
21:19
make sure the functionality was working,
21:21
which it is. Now, we can actually move
21:23
on to making this UI look way nicer,
21:26
right? So, that's what we're going to do
UI Design
21:28
now. Now, when it comes to creating a UI
21:29
you like, that has a lot to do with
21:31
personal taste. I suggest go find
21:32
websites you like, take screenshots,
21:34
bring them to Claude, and sort of work
21:35
backwards from there. But, one place
21:37
that's pretty good um is v0.appvz
21:40
owned by Versel. Verscell is what we're
21:42
going to use to deploy our application,
21:43
but they're also the creators of Nex.js,
21:45
which is part of our tech stack. Now, if
21:47
you come to this website, if you go to
21:49
design systems, let's say you were doing
21:50
something with dashboards, they have a
21:52
ton of different like dashboards
21:53
examples you can look at. If you go to
21:55
templates over here on the left, there
21:58
are a ton of templates that users have
22:00
created, and many of them actually look
22:02
really good. Now, let's say we wanted to
22:04
do this one, and you saw this one
22:05
earlier, which is this brutalist void
22:08
portfolio template, right? Looks pretty
22:11
sweet. So, how can I do this? Should I
22:13
just take a screenshot? Well, that's one
22:14
option. But if we're inside of V 0ero,
22:16
we can actually essentially dump all the
22:18
code inside of cloud code. So if you
22:20
want to do that, I'm just going to hit
22:21
open in V 0. I'm going to click these
22:23
three buttons on the top right. And then
22:27
I'm just going to copy this command
22:29
right here. Right? So three buttons,
22:31
copy that command.
22:34
We're then going to go into cloud code
22:35
and we're going to say, hey, I want to
22:37
work on the UI now. I want to
22:39
essentially copy this UI design. And
22:41
you're going to paste that command. So,
22:42
I just wrote, "Let's work on making the
22:44
UI look nice." Now, I want to copy the
22:46
style, but with our content. I found it
22:48
on V 0 and then I pasted that command in
22:50
there. And then we're just going to hit
22:51
go. All right. So, Claude just finished
22:53
up with our UI redesign. That took it
22:54
somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. And
22:56
so, we're just going to follow the link
22:57
and see what it looks like. And here's
22:59
what it came up with, right? Pretty darn
23:02
close. Essentially the same as the
23:05
example we gave it, right? We got this
23:06
really cool hero page. We got some nice
23:09
scrolling animations, some nice visuals,
23:12
right? This looks good, you know. So,
23:14
all we would do now is we would go
23:16
through each page and just make sure the
23:17
UI actually stuck. So, over here on the
23:20
dashboard, we have that same font, that
23:22
same kind of black and red vibe. Like,
23:24
this looks really good. And if there was
23:26
anything in particular I didn't like,
23:27
it'd be simple as me taking screenshots
23:29
of that particular item, bringing it
23:31
back to Claude Code, and say, "Hey,
23:32
let's fix this. Let's fix that." We're
Deployment
23:34
pretty much done with local testing,
23:35
right? We know everything works. We like
23:37
how it looks. Now, I want to get it out
23:39
there in the real world. I want to
23:40
deploy it. And that's going to be
23:42
somewhat of a two-step process. First,
23:44
we're going to push all this code to
23:45
GitHub. And then once it's inside of
23:47
GitHub, then we're going to go to
23:48
Verscell and it's going to connect to
23:50
GitHub and it's going to spin everything
23:52
up. The nice thing about that is anytime
23:53
we make a change to our code, it will
23:55
get pushed to GitHub, which then
23:57
automatically updates forcell, which
23:59
automates our active deployment, right?
24:01
So, it's always going to have the latest
24:03
version ready to go. So, what you're
24:04
going to do, you're going to go to
24:05
github.com. You're going to create an
24:07
account. It's totally free. You're going
24:09
to see this dashboard. We're going to
24:10
create a new repository.
24:13
We're just going to call it nas
24:16
YouTube.
24:18
And then you can keep this as private.
24:21
We're then going to create repository.
24:23
And see all this. You can just copy this
24:25
right here, all this stuff. And then
24:27
we're just going to bring that to cloud
24:29
code. We're going to say, hey, it's time
24:30
to commit it to GitHub. Now, when you do
24:33
this inside of Cloud Code, it may ask
24:34
you to like connect certain GitHub
24:36
accounts. You may need to do that the
24:38
first time you run this, but once you do
24:39
that, it's a very smooth process. Now,
24:41
before we actually commit it, what I
24:42
like to do just to kind of give me warm
24:44
and fuzzy feeling is I'll just tell it
24:45
run a production build and fix any
24:47
errors before we commit this to GitHub
24:48
and deploy. This kind of just lets it do
24:50
a final once over to make sure we didn't
24:53
miss anything. So, after it's done its
24:55
once over, go ahead, paste in that
24:57
information we took from GitHub and tell
24:58
Claude Code to commit your codebase.
25:00
Once you've done that, you can go back
25:02
into GitHub, just refresh that page
25:03
you're on, and you should see all of
25:05
your code right here. Now, we're going
25:07
to move to Verscell and actually deploy
25:08
this. So, you're going to go to
25:09
versell.com. You're going to create an
25:11
account. Make sure you connect your
25:13
GitHub account to Versel, right? We want
25:15
those two things connected. You're then
25:17
going to go to overview. We're going to
25:19
add new project. And then it should
25:21
automatically import your GitHub
25:23
repository. So, I'm just going to click
25:26
import on the NAN SAS one we just did.
25:29
Now, when we get to this page, we're
25:30
going to need to add some of our
25:31
environment variables. And you'll notice
25:33
that Claude Code tells us to do that as
25:36
well. Now, of note, if it tells you to
25:38
pass the next public app URL and it
25:40
tells you to set the Verscell deployment
25:42
URL, just go ahead and tell it that
25:44
you're not going to know the deployment
25:45
URL until after we deploy and it may
25:48
make a few changes to your code. But
25:51
beyond that, what you're going to do is
25:53
these first four, we're just going to
25:55
copy them. go inside of here and just
25:58
paste them in there and get rid of that
25:59
empty one. Next, you're just going to
26:01
deploy. Now, when we're deploying it,
26:03
understand we may run into issues here,
26:05
just like we ran into issues with the
26:07
functionality. And we're just going to
26:08
go through the same process. It'll give
26:09
you an error. You'll give it the cloud
26:11
code and you'll keep iterating until it
26:13
fixes it. And I promise you, it's going
26:15
to fix it. Okay. So, right on Q, it
26:17
looks like we had a deployment fail with
26:18
a certain error. So, all you're going to
26:20
do is you're going to copy this. You'll
26:21
come back to cloud code and just say got
26:23
deployment error and then paste it in
26:27
there. Right? And then just continue to
26:28
repeat this process until the deployment
26:31
succeeds. All right. So after that first
26:32
hookup, it was able to deploy. And
26:34
you'll get a page that looks like this.
26:36
So I'm just going to go to continue to
26:38
dashboard.
26:40
And right here we have the domain. Now
26:42
you can always go out and buy your own
26:44
domain, right? They're giving you a
26:45
domain right here. But it's super easy
26:47
to come into the dashboard and add a
26:49
real domain. But they give you this one
26:51
for free. So if I click on it,
26:55
I'm here on our app. And the final step
Production Testing
26:58
is just to make sure that everything
27:00
works. So just like we tested everything
27:02
in the local dev server, now would be
27:05
the time to go through all the pages, to
27:07
go through all the steps, right? Logging
27:08
in, creating a new account, doing the
27:10
analysis, and making sure it works.
27:12
Because sometimes things can be a little
27:14
different when they're on the production
27:15
side versus when it's done locally. Now,
27:17
let me run through some of the common
27:19
things you'll need to update when you go
27:20
to production. First will be superbase.
27:22
So, if you go to superbase, you go to
27:24
authentication on the left and then you
27:26
go to URL configuration. We're going to
27:29
have to update this because before it
27:30
was going to the local host when we
27:32
created a new account. Now, it needs to
27:33
go to our updated URL. You'll just need
27:36
to replace that with your new URL and
27:38
then slash off/allback. If you get
27:41
confused, just bring your new domain to
27:43
cloud code and say, "Hey, I have a new
27:45
domain. Do I need to update anything
27:46
inside of Superbase? It'll walk you
27:48
through that step by step. And the next
27:49
thing you need to do is just run the
27:51
functionality test. You will probably
27:53
get some sort of error because there's
27:54
some disconnect between going from the
27:56
local testing to prod. Again, just copy
27:59
the entire error you get, bring it to
28:00
Claude, and troubleshoot. And after one
28:03
round of troubleshooting, we got it
28:05
working, which is awesome. And so, this
Final Thoughts
28:07
is where I'm going to leave you today.
28:09
And we've actually covered quite a lot.
28:11
We've gone from the single NADN
28:14
automation and we actually have turned
28:16
it into a full-blown AI SAS product.
28:19
Now, the work is definitely not done.
28:21
What you have in your hands right now is
28:23
an MVP. This is something you can
28:25
actually take to the market and ask, do
28:27
people care about it and will they buy
28:29
it? The next steps are just that, adding
28:32
some sort of payment structure with
28:34
Stripe. Again, Claude Code can walk you
28:36
through that. And then actually the
28:38
nitty-gritty details of making sure
28:40
everything works exactly how you want
28:42
it. Right? This is very bare metal,
28:44
right? It gave us the functionality, but
28:46
we can mess with things with the UI. We
28:48
can change the user experience. There's
28:49
a ton you can work on, but the point is
28:51
you now have the foundation
28:53
infrastructure to do that without
28:55
writing a single line of code. So, I
28:57
hope you were able to get a lot out of
28:58
this video. As always, leave some
29:00
comments down below. Let me know what
29:01
you thought. Definitely check out the
29:02
school resources. We have tons of free
29:04
resources as well as the Chase AI Plus
29:06
community, which is if you're a little
29:07
more serious about turning AI into a
29:09
career and making money. But either way,
29:11
thanks for watching and I'll see you

## 1. Project Overview: SK AutoSphere "Trade OS"

**Project Title:** Deep-Tech Autonomous Cross-Border Trade Operating System (Trade-OS)

**One-Line Pitch:** A Multi-Agent AI Swarm that manages the entire lifecycle of mobility assets—from **Real-Time Auction Acquisition (RL)** to **Domestic Lifecycle Management** to **Autonomous Cross-Border Logistics**.

**Business Summary:**
SK AutoSphere is the world's first "Full-Lifecycle Mobility OS" that unifies the three critical stages of a vehicle's economic life into a single Deep-Tech ecosystem:

1.  **Acquisition (Supply Side):** AI-driven bidding in Korean B2B auctions (Reinforcement Learning).
2.  **Utilization (Domestic Lifecycle):** Domestic subscription & maintenance data tracking (Predictive Maintenance).
3.  **Export (Global Trade):** Autonomous verification and logistics to emerging markets (Computer Vision & Graph Networks).

Our "Super Gap" technology replaces fragmented intermediaries with a **Federated Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that orchestrates asset movement based on purely economic data, resolving the "Lemon Market" asymmetry in the $X Billion Korea-to-Global trade.

## 2. Technical Core: The "Agent Swarm" Architecture

_Applicable to: 2026 DIPS - Core AI Track_

To secure the "Super Gap" designation, we present a unified **Agent Swarm** where each module feeds data to the others, creating a proprietary "Global Context Vector."

### Phase 1: The Export Swarm (Current Core)

_Focus: Trust & Logistics_

- **Agent 1: "Truth Scanner" (Vision AI):** Uses Generative Defect Modeling to detect rust/structural damage invisible to standard models.
- **Agent 2: "Parts Specialist" (3D/OCR):** Automated "Snap-to-Part" recognition for repair parts, cross-referencing vehicle health data.
- **Agent 3: "Captain Cargo" (Logistics):** Dynamic "Customs Knowledge Graph" optimizing shipping routes to 54 nations.

### Phase 2: The supply "Auction Agent" (Extension)

_Focus: Deep Tech Acquisition_

- **Technology:** **Reinforcement Learning (DQN/PPO)**.
- **Function:** An autonomous bidding agent connected via WebSocket to live Korean auctions (Hyundai Glovis, Lotte).
- **Deep Tech Innovation:** It doesn't just bid; it _predicts_ the winning price based on 10,000+ historical auctions and real-time bidder sentiment analysis. It executes sub-second bids to capture assets at arbitrage-positive prices.
- _Why this fits DIPS:_ High-frequency decision making using proprietary RL models.

### Phase 3: The "Lifecycle Agent" (Data Loop)

_Focus: Predictive Value Retention_

- **Technology:** **Time-Series Forecasting & Digital Twins**.
- **Function:** Manages the domestic "Lifestyle Platform" (Subscription/Rentals).
- **Deep Tech Innovation:** Instead of being a simple rental app, it acts as a **Data Generator**. It tracks every km driven and maintenance event to update the vehicle's "Export Value" in real-time.
- _The "Super Gap":_ When a domestic subscription ends, the AI _automatically_ lists the car for export to Nigeria if the arbitrage spread is positive, creating a seamless "Cradle-to-Grave" asset pipeline.

## 3. The Unified Data Fusion Advantage

Our competitors run isolated businesses (Auction Proxy, Rental App, Export Site). SK AutoSphere validates its "Deep Tech" status by fusing these data streams:

| Data Source          | AI Agent Processing           | Strategic Output                                            |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auction Streams**  | **Auction Agent (RL)**        | Acquires undervalued inventory automatically.               |
| **Domestic Driving** | **Lifecycle Agent (IoT)**     | Predicts exact maintenance needs before export.             |
| **Global Demand**    | **Matchmaker Agent (Vector)** | Pre-sells the asset to an African buyer before acquisition. |

## 4. Key "Super Gap" Technologies to Emphasize

1.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Bidder:**
    - _Highlight:_ Proprietary PPO model trained on 3 years of auction logs to beat human bidders by margins of 3-5%.
2.  **Cross-Vertical Transfer Learning:**
    - _Highlight:_ Using domestic "Lifestyle" maintenance data to train the "Truth Scanner" vision model, making it 99% accurate on finding wear-and-tear patterns.
3.  **African-Specific SLMs (Small Language Models):**
    - _Highlight:_ Fine-tuned language models that understand both Korean Auction Sheets (technical jargon) and African Trade Dialects (negotiation context).

## 5. Strategic Roadmap for Grant Funding

- **Year 1 (Foundation):** Deploy "Truth Scanner" (Vision) and "Auction Agent" (RL Bidding MVP).
- **Year 2 (Integration):** Launch "Lifecycle Platform" to gather proprietary maintenance training data; link "Auction" purchases directly to "Export" logistics.
- **Year 3 (Autonomy):** Full "Trade-OS" activation where the system autonomously buys, rents, and eventually exports vehicles with zero human intervention.
